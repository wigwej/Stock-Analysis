# Stock-Analysis
**Which stock is best for Steve's parents?**
***Project Overview***
Steve seeks to assist his parents determine stock which would provide the best return for his parents. From an array of 12 stocks, with our assistance, Steve deploying excel and VBA programming found out that the Daqo stocks dropped over 63% in 2018. We would refactor using same data to analyse the stock to seive out the best for Steve's parents.

***Results***
VSLR had the highest daily volume of 3306038200 with the least drop in return of about 4%. it was closely followed by TERP which had a daily volume of 3169499100 and a drop in return of approximatet 5%. while AY had the next lowest drop in return, its daily volume of 83079900 was the lowest. RUN had the highest return drop of abot 84%, while it had a huge daily volume of 2242827800. The best bet for Steve's parents is the VSLR stock and then the TERP. As well as avoiding Daqo stock, they should also avoid ENPH which has a volume of 999307200 and a drop of about 82%
